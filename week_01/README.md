- Define functions for operators.
    - Addition.
    - Subtraction.
    - Multiply.

- Ask user for input of the **first number.**
    - Store first number in a variable.
- Ask user for input of the **second number.**
    - Store second number in a variable.

- Ask user which **operator** they want to use.
    - Create a variable for the operator.
