## :book: This is the pseudocode of my calculator.

- Define functions for operators.
    - Addition.
    - Subtraction.
    - Multiply.
    - Division.
    - Exponentiation.

- Ask user for input of the **first number.**
    - Store first number in a variable.
- Ask user for input of the **second number.**
    - Store second number in a variable.

- Ask user which **operator** they want to use.
    - Create a variable for the operator.
    - If user input wrong operator, loop to ask for input again.

Print out the math function with the **result.** :confetti_ball:
Ask if user want another calculation?

Here are some extra resources that I used:
- [while loop](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp)
- [try and except](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_try_except.asp)
