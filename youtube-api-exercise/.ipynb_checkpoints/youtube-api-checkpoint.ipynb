       "2   If you actually read Qanon posts for yourself, you'll realize that he's only pointing out to people to look at a certain direction and at doors that have been opened. He does not force people to walk through those doors but rather to think for themselves and not simply trusting MSM and the likes (like NYT ðŸ¤ª). The \"horde\" of Qanon followers is simply the result of people doing their own thinking and soul searching and reaching their own conclusions (of which they are entitled too under the 1st Amendment). I'm grabbing my popcorn as I watch how MSM and big tech are digging their own grave and running scared about the explosion of truth that is about to come.\\n\\nWhether Qanon is an agent provocateur or a patriot, he has the effect of getting people to think for themselves and not simply trust in what they've be told by the system like lemmings. The rest are still under the \"mind-control\" (for lack of a better word), of their own institutionalized conformity.\\n\\nApparently, a world rul...   \n",
